# readme
I create this folder to write the thing I learned to understand this repository

I focus on HpBandSter/hpbandster/core/  and HpBandSter/hobandster/examples

to understand the code, I first learned the `multiprocess` module (which usually imported as `multiprocessing`)

then I read the first four examples in the ../examples/ folder and read related part in the ../core/ filder
