## ‘After X simultaneous proxy connections, Pyro seems to freeze!’ Fix: Release your proxies when you can.
**清除长期空闲线程的方法**

A connected proxy that is unused takes up resources on the server. In the case of the threadpool server type, it locks up a single thread. If you have too many connected proxies at the same time, the server may run out of threads and won’t be able to accept new connections.

You can use the THREADPOOL_SIZE config item to increase the maximum number of threads that Pyro will use. Or use the multiplex server instead, which doesn’t have this limitation. Another option is to set COMMTIMEOUT to a certain value on your server, which will free up unused connections after the given time. But your client code may now crash with a TimeoutError or ConnectionClosedError when it tries to use a proxy that worked earlier. You can use Pyro’s autoreconnect feature to work around this but it makes the code more complex.

It is however advised to close (release) proxies that your program no longer needs, to free resources both in the client and in the server. Don’t worry about reconnecting, Pyro does that automatically for you once the proxy is used again. You can use explicit _pyroRelease calls or use the proxy from within a context manager. It’s not a good idea to release it after every single remote method call though, because then the cost of reconnecting the socket can be bad for performance.
